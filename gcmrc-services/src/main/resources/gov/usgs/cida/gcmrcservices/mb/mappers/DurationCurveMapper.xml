					 INTERPOLATION SETTINGS **
					In general, it is assumed that real data exists between individual measurements and the value of
					that real data can be determined by interpolation.  However, it wouldn't make sense to interpolate
					b/t two values *very* far apart in time - that limit is set by MAX_INTERPOLATION_DAYS.

					Sometime there is a known time period of invalid data.  This is recorded as a time period bounded
					by the DATA_GAP_MARKER in the FINAL_VALUE column.  The DB ensures that no values occur in the timeseries
					b/t DATA_GAP_MARKER's.  The DATA_GAP_MARKER is always -999.

					Interpolation can still be done through invalid time periods if the invalid time period is less than
					MAX_GAP_MINUTES.

					ASSUMPTION:  THE DB CONTAINS NO DATA WITH -999 VALUES THAT ARE NOT CONSECUTIVE.

					   A MTI is a period of known time and measured values that occurs between two individual measurements.
					   Thus, it has a starting value, an ending value, a starting time and an ending time.  As an example,

						   DB1        DB2        DB3

					   The db countains measured time-ordered results DB1, DB2 and DB3, each with a time and value.
					   This result of the example above would be:
						MTI1: Start_Time and Start_Value from the time and value of DB1, End_Time
						 and End_Value from the time and value of DB2.
						MTI2:  Similar to Result1, just shifted.

					 different types of data-bin combos and UNION the results togetheer.  The advantage

							increasing from initial measure to ending measure, so instead of working with
							the start and end value, most of the comparisons are done using min and max
							values of an MTI.

							The bins define a high and low bound, and there are four cases of how an
							MTI could line up with an individual bin:
							|      |      |      |

							|      |   *==|=*    | Case 3:  The MTI spans beyond the upper bound (but not the lower)
							|      | *==* |      | Case 4:  The MTI is completely within the upper and lower bounds of the bin
							|      |      |      |
